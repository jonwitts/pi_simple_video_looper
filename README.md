# pi_simple_video_looper
A Bash Video Looper for the Raspberry Pi and a Python3 shutdown button and LED indicator

To install either clone this repo to a Raspberry Pi with wifi setup on it and run setup.sh as root, or run this command:

curl -L http://bit.ly/PiLooper | sudo bash

N.B. It is generally not a good idea to pipe the output of a shirtened URL straight into a root shell; but follow the link first and you will see it takes you to the setup.sh file and processes that for you!
